# Image-Segmentation--Color-Spaces--Matlab

# 1. Objective

To implement and compare color-based image segmentation using different color spaces.

# 2. Motivation

Color image segmentation is a very emerging topic for image processing research. Since it has the ability to present the result in a way that is much more close to the
human eyes perceive, so todayâ€™s more research is going on this area. Choosing a proper color space is a very important issue for color image segmentation process. Generally the HSV and CIELAB color spaces are the two frequently chosen color spaces for color segmentation, instead of using the RGB color space. 

In this work, we implement color-based image segmentation using RGB, HSV and CIELAB color spaces and present a quanoitative comparison of the segmentation results obtained by using the 3 different color spaces.

# 2. The input Images

We select 2 simple and colorful input images, as illustrated next.

  <div class="column">

  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <img src="images/image-02.jpg" width="500">
  </div>

# 3. Approach


Color based image segmentation is an active research field. It is typically not performed in the RGB space. Instead it is applied in more suitable color spaces that
separate Luma (brightness/intensity) from Chroma (color). Suitable color spaces include:
* HSV:
   * HS: color information
   * V: Intensity information
* CIELAB:
   * L: Luminance information
   * AB: Color information
   * Euclidian distance between colors is consistent with perceptual difference observed by human beings
* Others color spaces include YCrCb , YUV, HSI, HSL, etc.

In this work, we implement a color based image segmentation using the HSV and CIELAB color spaces. Although this is not adviseable, we also perform the segmentation in the traditional RGB space in order to identify the deficiences of doing this and highlight the benefits of conducting color segmentation in the other color spaces.

The color-based segmentation process can be outlined as follows:
1.Convert the input image to the color space of choice
2.Apply K-means clustering algorithm to segment the K different colors in the new color space
3.Construct a segmentation label map from the K-means clustering results

These steps can easily be implemented in MATLAB as illustrated in the next figures.

4. Conclusion

Inthis project, we designed and implemented a color camera image signal processing (ISP) pipeline to process images acquired under poor illumination nighttime conditions. We illustrated the output of each module of the pipeline and demonstrated that final output image has significantly better quality and its scene contents can easily be detected and recognized by the human eyes as well as autkmated computer vision systems, inspite of the challenging nighttime illumination conditions.
